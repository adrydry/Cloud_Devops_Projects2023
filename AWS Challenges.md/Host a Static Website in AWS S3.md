HOST A STATIC WEBSITE ON AWS
Static websites deliver HTML, JavaScript, images, video and other files to your website visitors. Static websites are very low cost, provide high-levels of reliability, require almost no IT administration, and scale to handle enterprise-level traffic with no additional work.

Amplifyâ€™s hosting solution leverages Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3 to deliver your site assets via the AWS content delivery network (CDN).
